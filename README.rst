aiorabbit
=========
aiorabbit is an opinionated AsyncIO RabbitMQ client for `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ (3.7+).

|Version| |Status| |Coverage| |License|

Project Goals
-------------
- To create a simple, robust `RabbitMQ <https://rabbitmq.com>`_ client library for `AsyncIO <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ development in Python 3.
- To make use of new features and capabilities in Python 3.7+.
- Remove some complexity in using an `AMQP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol>`_ client by:
   - Abstracting away the AMQP channel and use it only as a protocol coordination mechanism inside the client.
   - Remove the `nowait <https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#domain.no-wait>`_ keyword to ensure a single round-trip pattern of behavior for client usage.
- To automatically reconnect when a connection is closed due to an AMQP exception/error.

  *When such a behavior is encountered, the exception is raised, but the client continues to operate if the user catches and logs the error.*
- To automatically create a new channel when the channel is closed due to an AMQP exception/error.

  *When such a behavior is encountered, the exception is raised, but the client continues to operate if the user catches and logs the error.*
- To ensure correctness of API usage, including values passed to RabbitMQ in AMQ method calls.

Example Use
-----------
The following demonstrates an example of using the library to publish a message with publisher confirmations enabled:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import datetime
    import uuid

    import aiorabbit

    RABBITMQ_URL = 'amqps://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f'


    async def main():
        async with aiorabbit.connect(RABBITMQ_URL) as client:
            await client.confirm_select()
            if not await client.publish(
                    'exchange',
                    'routing-key',
                    'message-body',
                    app_id='example',
                    message_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
                    timestamp=datetime.datetime.utcnow()):
                print('Publishing failure')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
